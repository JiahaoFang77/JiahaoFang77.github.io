My name is Jiahao Fang, and I am currently a Master of Science (M.S.) student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). [cite_start]My current research, supervised by Prof. [Fan Lai](https://www.fanlai.me/), focuses on **KV Cache Management for Large Language Model (LLM) Serving**[cite: 13, 23]. [cite_start]I graduated from UIUC with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science[cite: 8].

[cite_start]During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working as a research assistant with Prof. [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) on the AIDB project [cite: 26][cite_start], which resulted in a publication at the DEEM workshop @ SIGMOD 2024[cite: 43]. [cite_start]I also gained experience in machine learning and computational imaging through an independent study with Prof. [Jane Zhao](https://zhizhenz.ece.illinois.edu/)[cite: 31, 34].
