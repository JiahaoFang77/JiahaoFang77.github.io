My name is Jiahao Fang, and I have just graduated from UIUC as an ECE undergraduate student with a Computer Science minor. I will be starting my graduate studies in the MSCS program at UIUC in August, 2024. I worked closely with Prof. [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) with AIDB during my senior year as an undergraduate research assistant. I also gained the experience of taking independent study course of Machine Learning with Prof. [Jane Zhao](https://zhizhenz.ece.illinois.edu/).

You can view my [most recent CV](https://JiahaoFang77.github.io/files/Jiahao_Fang_CV.pdf), [official transcripts from UIUC](https://JiahaoFang77.github.io/files/Jiahao_Fang_UIUC_Official_Transcript.pdf), [official transcripts from ZJUI](https://JiahaoFang77.github.io/files/Jiahao_Fang_ZJUI_Official_Transcript.pdf), and [publications](https://jiahaofang77.github.io/publications/) here.
