I am Jiahao Fang from Zhejiang University and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring Electrical Engineering and expected to receive the degree of Bachelor of Science with CS Minor in May, 2024. I am now working closely with Prof. [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) with AIDB. I also gained the experience of taking independent study course of Machine Learning with Prof. [Jane Zhao](https://zhizhenz.ece.illinois.edu/).
